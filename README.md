# Petatet
**A social media app made for Petatet animal shelter.**

## Description  
Petatet was built using an existing API, as an update to a much older app. The previous app had an outdated UI and was malfunctioning badly. I did not have access to the old app's source code or to the API documentation, but the PHP script was available. Although some aspects of the code might be far from irreproachable, please keep in mind that the project's scope was rather large and the majority of it was completed in under a week.
